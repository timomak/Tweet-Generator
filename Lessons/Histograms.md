## Class 2: Histogram Data Structures

### Activities
- Compare code quality and techniques for rearranging words
- Compare code quality for getting random dictionary words
- Interactive code quiz on execution of Python scripts and modules

### Objectives
After completing this class session and the associated tutorial challenges, students will be able to ...
- Split strings into components to find words
- Build a histogram to count word occurrences
- Create and use dictionary, list, and tuple data types

### Challenges
These challenges are the baseline required to complete the project and course.
Be sure to complete these before next class session and before starting on the stretch challenges below.
