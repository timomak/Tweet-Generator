## Class 10: Higher Order Markov Chains

### Activities
- Code review implementations of hash table class instance methods
- Lecture and discussion on building higher order Markov chains with larger window sizes

### Objectives
After completing this class session and the associated tutorial challenges, students will be able to ...
- Build higher order Markov chains based on observed frequency of *n*-grams (tuples of *n* words) in text
- Generate sentences by sampling words by performing random walks on higher order Markov chain
- Utilize a linked list as a queue to track words in a Markov chain's *n*-gram window

### Resources
- Read Victor Powell's [visual explanation of Markov chains] and play with the interactive animated diagrams
- Read Alex Dejeu's [article on how Markov chains work][Dejeu Markov article], with great examples specific to this project (especially section B, "Further Markov Model Topics" and its subsection 3, "Bigger Windows" on creating higher order Markov chains)
- Read Dataiku's [article on using Markov chains with backoff][Dataiku Markov article] to generate Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton quotes
- Watch Make School's [Markov chains lecture]
- Review Make School's [Markov chains slides]

### Challenges
These challenges are the baseline required to complete the project and course.
Be sure to complete these before next class session and before starting on the stretch challenges below.
- [Page 11: Markov Chains Revisited]
    - Build a second order Markov chain by analyzing frequency of adjacent words in text
    - Sample a random word from a state histogram in second order Markov chain
    - Generate a sentence by performing a random walk on second order Markov chain
- [Page 12: Creating a Corpus]
    - Choose a source with at least 20,000 words (ideally, well over 100,000 words)
    - Collect your corpus (use Diffbot corpus collection script if needed)

### Stretch Challenges
These challenges are more difficult and help you push your skills and understanding to the next level.
- [Page 11: Markov Chains Revisited]
    - Extend code used to build second order Markov chain to build *n*-th order Markov chain for varying values of *n* (from 1 up to ~5)
    - Implement `MarkovChain` class to store states of word frequency histograms
        - Add methods for constructing state histograms and sampling words
    - Handle beginning and end of sentences with special start and stop tokens
    - Use a linked list as a queue to track words in Markov chain's *n*-gram window
    - Create a deque (double-ended queue) with a doubly-linked list
    - Implement a circular buffer (fixed-size queue) with a fixed-size array
