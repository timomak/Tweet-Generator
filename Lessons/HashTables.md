## Class 8: Hash Tables

### Activities
- Draw diagram of how a linked list data structure is stored in memory
- Compare and contrast diagram representations with partners
- Code review implementations of linked list class instance methods
- Lecture and discussion following [hash table slides]

### Objectives
After completing this class session and the associated tutorial challenges, students will be able to ...
- Describe what a hash function does to enable mapping arbitrary keys to integers
- Describe and diagram how a hash table uses arrays and linked lists to store key-value entries
- Explain what a hash collision is, why it happens, and at least one resolution technique
- Compare advantages and disadvantages of using hash tables versus arrays or linked lists
- Implement essential hash table class instance methods

### Resources
- Review Make School's [hash table slides]
- Watch Make School's [hash table video lecture]
- Watch HackerRank's [hash table video]
- Watch Harvard's [old hash table video] and [new hash table video]
- Play with VisuAlgo's [interactive hash table visualization][VisuAlgo hash table]
- Read Wikipedia's [hash table article]

### Challenges
These challenges are the baseline required to complete the project and course.
Be sure to complete these before next class session and before starting on the stretch challenges below.
- [Page 9: Hash Table]
    - Implement `HashTable` class using [hash table starter code] with these instance methods:
        - `length()` - return the number of entries (key-value pairs) in the hash table by traversing its buckets
        - `items()` - return a list of all entries (key-value pairs) in the hash table
        - `keys()` - return a list of all keys in the hash table
        - `values()` - return a list of all values in the hash table
        - `contains(key)` - return a boolean indicating whether `key` is in the hash table
        - `get(key)` - return the value associated with `key` in the hash table, or raise `KeyError` if not found
        - `set(key, value)` - insert `key` (or update, if already present) with associated `value` in the hash table
        - `delete(key)` - delete `key` and associated value from the hash table, or raise `KeyError` if not found
    - Run `python hashtable.py` to test `HashTable` class instance methods on a small example
    - Run `pytest hashtable_test.py` to run the [hash table unit tests] and fix any failures

### Stretch Challenges
These challenges are more difficult and help you push your skills and understanding to the next level.
- [Page 9: Hash Table]
    - Add several magic methods to allow subscripting syntax like the [Python `dict` type]
    - Want to make the `HashTable` class more convenient to use? Add methods so that it can be used as an [iterable container], such as in a `for` loop
    - Consider an alternative approach to calculate the `length` of the hash table that doesn't require bucket traversal and implement it, then benchmark its running time against the first approach on small and large hash tables
    - Implement an alternative hash table [collision resolution] strategy instead of [separate chaining] (like [linear probing]) and consider what advantages and disadvantages this approach has over chaining with linked lists
    - Write additional test cases to expand the [hash table unit tests] to ensure your collision resolution strategy is robust
